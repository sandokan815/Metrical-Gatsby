    <h1>METRICAL PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p><strong><span>Last Updated: June 23, 2017</span></strong></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by Metrical, Inc. and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, "Metrical"). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our website, mobile application and Metrical's products and services that measure customer experience, satisfaction and product/brand loyalty (collectively, the "Services").</p>
    <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time-to-time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>

    <p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
    <p>Metrical takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>
    <p><strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
    <p>You may update, correct or delete information about you at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@metric.al">support@metric.al</a>.

We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.</p>
    <p><strong>Promotional Communications</strong></p>
    <p>You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from Metrical by following the instructions in those emails or by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:support@metric.al">support@metric.al</a>.

    <p><strong>Do Not Track</strong></p>
    <p>Do Not Track (or DNT) is a preference you can set in your browser to let websites you visit know that you do not want websites to collect certain information about you. Metrical does not support the Do Not Track browser setting. Metrical does not track visitors to its sites and therefore does not respond to DNT signals.</p>
